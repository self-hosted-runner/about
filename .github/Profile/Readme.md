# About Me

I'm a developer who enjoys working on a variety of projects using GitHub. I use self-hosted runners to run continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows for my GitHub repositories. 

## Self-Hosted Runners

I use self-hosted runners on an AWS Ubuntu server to run my workflows. This allows me to have more control over the resources used for my workflows and saves me money compared to using GitHub's hosted runners. 

To use self-hosted runners across multiple repositories, I've added the runner to my AWS Ubuntu server and configured it for each repository individually. This ensures that I can use the same runner across all my repositories and avoid resource conflicts.

## My Projects

Check out my GitHub profile to see the various projects I've worked on. You'll notice that all of them use self-hosted runners to run CI/CD workflows, helping me to ensure high code quality and rapid deployments.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project!
